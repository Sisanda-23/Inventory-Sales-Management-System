# Inventory & Sales Management System

A console-based Inventory and Sales Management System built using C# and SQLite.  
This project demonstrates clean architecture, relational database design, and core business logic commonly used in real-world systems.

## 🚀 Features

- Product management (add, view, update stock, delete)
- Customer management with search functionality
- Order creation with automatic total calculation
- Inventory stock updates after each order
- Input validation and error handling
- Relational database design (Customers, Products, Orders, OrderItems)

## 🧱 Architecture

The application follows a clean, layered architecture:

- **Models** – Business entities
- **Repositories** – Database access logic
- **Services** – Business rules and calculations
- **Console UI** – User interaction layer

This separation improves maintainability and scalability.
